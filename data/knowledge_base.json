Pending charges usually auto-resolve within 3-5 business days. If charges are fully posted (not pending), a manual refund must be initiated by the billing team. Customers should be advised NOT to dispute charges with their bank until our billing team has reviewed the case, as bank disputes can complicate the refund process.",
